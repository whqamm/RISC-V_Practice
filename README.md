# RISC-V_Practice

This is a project for the Verilog course.

This project includes a RISC-V CPU with five stages. Five stages mean the Instruction Fetch (IF), Instruction Decode (ID), 
Execute (EX), Memory (MEM) and Write Back (WB).

According to the requirement, we need to implement 7 instruction as follows:

1. ADD
2. SRA
3. ORI
4. LH——load half word
5. SW——Store Word
6. JAL
7. BEQ
